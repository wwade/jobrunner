## Intro
Thanks for helping out!  I'll make every effort to respond to PRs in a relateively short time, once the CI has passed, at least.

## Development Environment
See [README.rst](README.rst).

## Guidelines
1. Please try to keep PRs on a single topic.  Generally this means that they'll invlove a "small" number of commits, and that each commit contains the minimal changes for its purpose.
2. Since we don't have `gofmt`, just run `./format.sh` before committing your changes.
3. If you don't hear back on your PR in a "reasonable" time, just send me an email :)
